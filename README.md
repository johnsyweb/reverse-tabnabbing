# Reverse Tabnabbing Demonstration

This is a simple, interactive demonstration of a reverse tabnabbing attack based on code from [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Reverse_Tabnabbing).

In this demonstration, all of the pages are on the same domain but in reality the community-provided link would be to a page on a third-party domain, as would the phishing page.

Start at https://johnsy.com/reverse-tabnabbing/ , open the provided link, close the new tab and see how the page you were on has changed.

See https://github.com/johnsyweb/reverse-tabnabbing/pull/1 for how to prevent these attacks.
